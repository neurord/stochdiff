Species and reactions

The ReactionTable class covers everything needed about the reacting species and their 
reactions. 

It is all implemented in primitive arrays (ie, not objects) partly for efficiency, and 
partly for ease of conversion/compilation in c or c++.

The table holds the data, and also has methods to evaluate functions using the data, such 
as the reaction rate matrix. 
Should probably also include stochastic next reaction time calculations when implememted.
